# SoftEther Autoinstaller

This is my SoftEther autoinstaller. This script will *hopefully* make your life a little easier. I have not made **any** modifications to the SoftEther VPN Project code at all, this script simply downloads the latest build and compiles it for use on your supported system.

To get started, all you have to do is copy/paste the provided code for your OS. The script will handle everything else for you. Refer to the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/lkutsenok/softether-autoinstall#quick-start-guide) if you need to get set up quickly. Also refer to the [Commands List](https://github.com/lkutsenok/softether-autoinstall#commands-list) should you need them.

## Supported Operating Systems (64-bit only)
#### Ubuntu 16.04 LTS +
```bash
wget -O se-install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lkutsenok/softether-autoinstall/master/ubuntu/se-install-ubuntu.bash && chmod +x se-install && ./se-install
```

#### CentOS 7 (Currently depreciated, no longer in development)
```bash
curl -o se-install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lkutsenok/softether-autoinstall/master/centos/x64/se-install-centos.bash && chmod 770 se-install && ./se-install
```
## Open Ports for SoftEther VPN
### Ubuntu
In terminal, execute the following: `ufw allow 443,1194,5555/tcp && ufw allow 500,1701,4500/udp`    

Please make sure you allow the port you use for SSH, otherwise you risk blocking inbound SSH connections. You can use `ufw allow ssh` or if you have set a custom port, use `ufw enable x/tcp` where `x = port`. For instance, if I use port `2222` for SSH, I'll use `ufw allow 2222/tcp`.    

Now enable UFW with `ufw enable`.

## Using Local Bridge Setting on SoftEther VPN
The Local Bridge Setting on SoftEther VPN allows you to run your own DHCP server on the VPN. This has much better performance than the built-in SecureNAT function. For instance, you can expect your Internet throughput speeds to increase by 100+ mbps (if your connection can handle it). It is important that you manually configure SoftEther VPN to use the new local bridge after setting this up. It will be outlined below.

By default, the IP addresses handed out by dnsmasq will be 10.42.10.10 - 10.42.10.100. The default gateway is 10.42.10.1.

### Installation (Ubuntu)
There's two methods of doing this. If you've already set up the SoftEther VPN Server, use the script below.
``` bash
wget -O se-install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lkutsenok/softether-autoinstall/master/ubuntu/se-install-ubuntu.bash && chmod +x se-install && ./se-install
```

If you are just now installing SoftEther VPN Server, then select option 1 when asked "Are you going to use the bridge option on the VPN server?".

### SoftEther VPN Server Configuration
**Disable SecureNAT** [example here](https://upload.icoexist.io/2019/04/2019-04-25_22-46-40.mp4)
- Open the SoftEther VPN Server Management Utility
- Connect to your VPN server
- Select the VPN hub (or whatever hub you use on the VPN server) and click “Manage Virtual Hub”
- Click “Virtual NAT And Virtual DHCP Server (SecureNAT)”
- Click Disable, then exit to main configuration screen

**Create Local Bridge** [example here](https://upload.icoexist.io/2019/04/2019-04-25_22-49-08.mp4)
- Click “Local Bridge Setting”
- Under “New Local Bridge Definition” select the VPN hub (or whatever hub you use on the VPN server)
- Select the “Bridge with New Tap Device”
- Name the device soft and click “Create Local Bridge”
- Verify that the new device was create by running ifconfig tap_soft in a SSH terminal session. You should see something like this:

![Output example](https://forum.icoexist.io/uploads/default/original/1X/b20b7e2c67d55a9b75238b53dc62797ee9d7fbb8.png)

### Enable NAT and enable postrouting
We need to create a file in /etc/sysctl.d/ to enable ipv4 forwarding. Use the following command to create this file:
`nano /etc/sysctl.d/ipv4_forwarding.conf`
and insert the following into the file:
`net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1`

Again, save and close the file by hitting Ctrl + X then [ENTER].

Now we must enable this new option by issuing the following command:
`sysctl --system`

Now we need to add a POSTROUTING rule to iptables to correctly route traffic and enable NAT. Please replace [YOUR VPS IP ADDRESS] with the public IP address of your server.
`iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.42.10.0/24 -j SNAT --to-source [YOUR VPS IP ADDRESS]`

This rule will exist until the next system reboot, so to keep it persistent we will install iptables-persistent
`apt install iptables-persistent`

### Restart dnsmasq and SoftEther VPN Server
If everything above was done correctly, all we need to do now is to restart the DHCP server and the running SoftEther VPN server.
`/etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart && /etc/init.d/vpnserver restart`

### Need help?
Check out the forum post [here](https://forum.icoexist.io/t/how-to-use-softether-vpn-with-local-bridge-ubuntu/91) for a more in-depth explanation. If you can't seem to get your server to work at all, try running the install script again so you get a fresh start.

## Uninstall SE-VPN Server [Ubuntu Only]
As of now, this bash script will only work with Ubuntu due to the use of `update-rc.d`.
```
wget -O se-uninstall https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lkutsenok/softether-autoinstall/master/ubuntu/se-uninstall.bash && chmod 770 se-uninstall && ./se-uninstall
```

## Configure SoftEther
### Execute vpncmd
To execute SoftEther's cmd utility, use `sudo /usr/local/vpnserver/vpncmd` <-- This applies if you used my scripts. If you've installed SE yourself, find the vpnserver directory.

With `vpncmd` you are able to change every option in regard to SoftEther. It has the same exact purpose for the GUI version you can obtain on MacOS and Windows. I encourage people to use `vpncmd` because it can be easier than the GUI, plus there's no need to download anything since you can configure the entire server from an SSH session.

### Set a server password
It is important that you set a server password. This should be the first thing you do after launching the `vpncmd` utility. To set a password, type `serverpasswordset` into your terminal after you've launched the `vpncmd` utility. For verification, you have to type the password twice.

### Quick-start Guide
This section will provide you with a list of things to get you started with your VPN server. I'll have more commands listed below this section.

1. Start the `vpncmd` utility with `sudo /usr/local/vpncmd`
2. Set a server password with `ServerPasswordSet`
3. Select the DEFAULT hub with `hub default`
4. Create a new user with `UserCreate` | You can either use `UserCreate` or `UserCreate [username]`
5. Set a password for the new user with `UserPasswordSet` | You can either use `UserPasswordSet` or `UserPasswordSet [username]`
6. Enable SecureNAT for the DEFAULT hub with `SecurenatEnable`

   Optional: You can enable L2TP/IPsec with `IpsecEnable`. It is recommended that if you use this option, you only enable L2TP/IPsec. Do not enable RAW L2TP w/o encrpytion. You will be asked to set a pre-shared key for the IPsec server, you can use anything. I've used `vpn` as a pre-shared key for ages. Remember that this is NOT a password for the server or a user, so it's safe to use that. You'll also be asked for the default hub in the event that a user does not specify the hub to connect to in their username, you'll set this to `default` if you haven't changed any hub names. If you're more advanced user and have multiple hubs, you can specify what hub a user connects to by putting it in their username on the client. For instance `icoexist@public` or `icoexist@hub2`.

If everything was done properly, you're ready to use your new VPN server! To add new users, just launch the `vpncmd` utility and repeat steps 3 - 5.

### Other Options
#### Change SoftEther Ports
You can change the ports that SoftEther VPN server will use to listen for incoming connections. If you're using the `vpncmd` utility, you can list the current ports with `listenerlist`.

`ListenerCreate` - Creates a new listener on a specified port   
`ListenerDelete` - Deletes a listener on a specfied port   
`ListenerEnable` - Enables a listener on a specified port   
`ListenerDisable` - Disables a listener on a specified port

#### Manage Users & User Policies
SoftEther VPN server allows you to manage users and their policies. Below are some popular commands and descriptions on what they do. Remember that you first have to select a hub before you can manage users, as each hub has its own users.

`UserList` - Displays a list of users   
`UserGet [username]` - Displays information on a specified user   
`UserCreate [username]` - Creates a user   
`UserPasswordSet [username]` - Sets a password for specified user   
`UserDelete` - Deletes a specified user   
`UserPolicySet` - Sets a policy for a specified user | It is recommended that you enable "Privacy Filter Mode" on all newly created users on the same hub, unless you WANT them to see each other. To do this, type `UserPolicySet` then when it asks for what policy, type `PrivacyFilter`. It will ask for the new value, to enable it enter `1`, to disable it enter `0`.   
`UserPolicyRemove` - Removes a policy from a specified user

#### Manage Hubs & Hub Policies
SoftEther VPN server also allows you to manage virtual hubs and their policies. Below are some popular commands and descriptions on what they do. Remember that you first have to select a hub before you can manage it.

`Hub [HubName]` - Selects a hub for management   
`HubCreate [HubName]` - Creates a new virtual hub   
`HubDelete [HubName]` - Deletes a specified hub   
`HubList` - Lists the virtual hubs on the VPN server   
`AdminOptionList` - Get List of Virtual Hub Administration Options   
`AdminOptionSet` - Set Values of Virtual Hub Administration Options
